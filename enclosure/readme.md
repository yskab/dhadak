STLs folder has the actual STL files which i used for printing. I don't own a printer, so i sent the files to a external printing service who printed and shipped to me. Models were printed in PLA with 20% infill and with supports.

Minimum Finger Height: 9mm, if more than this, spring action takes place
Maximum Finger Width: 20mm	

## Suggested Improvements
* top part's snap fit is is a bit tight, it's hard to fit and remove, need to add some clearance.
*  Battery holding rectangle structures are asymmetrical, not equal dimensions.
* Some Spring inserts were tight but was able to fit at least one, which is good enough for test purposes and keeps pressure on the finger. A better design can be used for spring inserts instead of cylindrical holes. Also, actual springs can be used instead of re-purposing safety pins.

*   The pivot(circular tab part) was not able to fit in the spring  hinge as it was difficult to line up the spring with holes. Should have measure the lengths of springs before cutting them.

*   PCB fits nice, also when the top is closed, there is no wobble and things are tight.
*   It can be a bit difficult to put springs inside, doable with tweezers.
*   The battery wiring hole was a bad idea. It is difficult to get the wire through battery clips and supports had to be removed from that area which is difficult to do. Internal supports took a lot of time to remove so battery (+),(-) wiring needs a better approach.
*   upper wall in the led compartment should have been a little lower to allow the led to sit properly instead of slipping into the led wiring hole.
*   Led compartment should have been tighter to avoid glue.
*   I ordered wrong kind of battery clips. These were intended for series connections not for holding 2 AAAs. Had to snap one in half so that I can get (+) and (-).
*   Design to avoid internal support structures as they are difficult to remove.

As a complete beginner in FreeCAD, listed tutorials below helped me a lot to get to speed and start working on my model. I referred them throught the design. I would suggest anyone who is a beginner to start with these tutorials below for FreeCAD:
